  ## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
  After cloning the repository, please update the sample.env file with your own credentials and change the file name back to ".env". After ensuring MySQL has been installed, use the MySQL terminal to run the SOURCE files to generate a template database - the seeds.sql file can be updated prior to running SOURCE to seed the database with user-relevant values. Then, install all runtime dependencies using "npm i" in GitBash (or equivalent). Enter "npm start" in the terminal to run the application.
